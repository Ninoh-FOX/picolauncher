**PicoLauncher** is a game launcher and 'operating system' for handheld consoles that run [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) natively. It seeks to streamline and revamp the PICO-8 gaming experience with features and apps like
- revamped games explorer
- photo gallery
- music player
- settings/preferences app
- on screen keyboard (coming soon)
- physical cartridges (coming soon)

**PicoLauncher** is developed for the [PeX Console](https://pex-labs.com/) by PeX Labs, however in the future support may come for other devices.

## Setting up for development

**PicoLauncher** requires an installed version of PICO-8 (if you don't have it, you can buy it [here](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php?#getpico8)), as well as a [rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
